Staging thing (Nothing here right now)

Ingredients:

Staging via a haskellish quasiquotation. Maybe levitation?

- A module that types the parts of the language ('term)
- A parser/unparser/optics text \lr 'term
- Helpers to generate 'term
- Holes

As for 'term \arrow term, we need
- An evaluator for things typed by the module
- Various other stuff

Remember:

The type safe interpreter/quotation/evaluator/meta-circular problem

Coeffects or something - what is the underlying computation/runtime

Typing a possible world

Quoters/unquoters

Non-actual-object oriented programming, as in manipulating things in the domain constructed in terms of the 'term module
